                                            Abortion is illegal in Cyprus up to the extent of a 14 years prison sentence except
                                            under certain narrowed exceptions. Nevertheless, European Union Law considers

                                            that EU Law explicitly overrides Cyprus national law, even on the criminalisation 
                                            of abortion, it follows that any Cypriot woman can vindicate her access to abortion,
                                            through the EU principle of freedom of services. This is in relation not only in 
                                            establishing access to abortion, but also in claiming refund for up to the total
                                            costs that occurred to the Cyprus woman by being forced to travel to another 
                                            Member State in fulfilling such task.
